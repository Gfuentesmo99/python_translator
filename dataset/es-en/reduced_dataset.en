We have made extensive progress over the last few years in relation to meeting these problems, for example with the systems installed in cars which have completed 80,000 kilometres and which were built over five years ago, to monitor the durability of anti-pollution equipment.
This anti-globalisation movement slogan could form the epigraph of our debate.
That is where we say precisely what is to be done, namely that the payments made by the European Union to Ethiopia and Eritrea should be linked to both countries' compliance with certain conditions.
in writing. - (HU) I welcome Mr Adamos Adamou's report on organ donation and the trade in organs.
in writing. - (LT) The European Union faces enormous challenges, one of the most important of these being population ageing.
We are ready to work constructively with the European Parliament and the Council in order to find good solutions for Europe and, possibly, for the rest of the world.
Thirdly, we need a European security and defence identity to complete the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
This is part of the package of six legislative texts on economic governance and aims to strengthen surveillance of budgetary positions, and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies.
That is why we are going to vote against the report, with the exception of certain parts, such as the fact that elections should be held in May and that dual mandates will not be allowed.
Mr President, we have just voted on the Commission proposal as modified by the amendments which we have just introduced.
Louise found out she had MS and was bitterly disappointed to learn that she simply had not been allowed to benefit from life enhancing medication.
But just look around this Chamber this morning, Mr Van Rompuy.
Furthermore, in this obstacle course which the applicant countries must tackle, and which is modestly referred to as the adoption of the acquis communautaire , I fear there is a tendency to be content with appearances and to sometimes fail to assess the adherence of these countries to Community policies in terms of values and beliefs.
Self-regulatory practices in the UK are already quite rigorous, and I would hope that other Member States would be open to embracing similar measures.
As I stressed on 18 September, the Council considers it essential that the European Parliament go along with this overall restrictive strategy concerning expenditure in the fields of agriculture and structural actions.
Mr Needle has produced an excellent and most welcome report, and has made considerable efforts to amend the Commission's text.
More so than at any other time in the past, it is especially important today to take uniform political action and to harmonise discordant national interests and positions.
The local offices could, though, be enabled to do that if – as has indeed already been announced – they had access to workable guidelines with which, for example, they could determine which market was relevant.
I recognize the impossibility of harmonizing legal systems but as the President-in-Office has said we have just agreed a convention on divorce.
We know the questions.
We voted in favour of an amendment to the legislative resolution that provided for data access to be regulated by that framework decision.
That is the first step and, in this regard, I am very eager to see the Commission's report and what conclusions it will draw.
In future, we will have to provide good quality technical assistance and financial support to ensure sufficient administrative capacity is available where required.
I do not think that is really a procedural motion. It has nothing to do with the Minutes either, although I am delighted to hear it.
However, the Commission considered that the political compromise in the Council was the best that was available at the time.
What is at stake is the fundamental basis of the international system, in place since 1945, and the law it embodies in the eyes of all democracies.
(PT) Mr President, I would like to say that it is not the Council's responsibility, nor that of the President-in-Office, to comment on the Intergovernmental Conference mandate resulting from the European Council negotiations in June, in particular the matter of the Charter.
Fine, but let it really serve the cause of the employees.
I am worried.
As is well known, the European Union is the world's number one donor of humanitarian aid, contributing approximately 40% of official international humanitarian assistance.
Since the Council has not, as yet, responded to our invitation, the Committee on Budgets has now, in the course of its deliberations on the coming financial year, renamed the budget line to which the Commission had appended the description 'Human Rights Agency' as the budget line for the 'European Union's Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia' and created a new one with the annotation 'for information'.
I am talking about the brain drain.
Then, most important of all, we got Rio+5. But, before everything starts to look too rosy of course, we have to add that, disappointingly, we did not achieve the aims we set ourselves.
We must be able to combine the two, and we should not surrender our political autonomy in search of a partnership that is, in itself, a commendable objective.
   . The position that was agreed when the accession countries were joining must be adhered to.
As I had the opportunity to inform the members of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, the Commission services are currently preparing a comprehensive document assessing the progress made in implementing the fourth framework programme, and this document will shortly be made available to Parliament.
My second point, Mrs Bowles, is that we need clarification on multilateral interchange fees.
If we do not do this, we will run the risk of confusing the financial perspectives with the annual budgets.
Military operations are continuing against other armed groups, including the FDLR and the Lord's Resistance Army.
Ripoll y Martinez de Bedoya report (A5-0140/2000)
As I have already stated when I expressed my support for the report on promoting agricultural products on the Community market and in third countries, wine is one of the Community's products which enjoys a dominant position on the global market and must assume a key role in Europe's commercial strategy.
How can we determine if future proposals for labelling and monitoring are adequate when we do not, as yet, know exactly what they are to be?
We, as Europeans, must therefore, keep the momentum going where the different peoples are involved.
Perhaps, Mr Barroso, it is a case of the right woman in the wrong job this time round, but I wish her well.
It will lead to the management of animal testing within the European Union, thereby answering the criticism of exporting the problem.
In addition, this strategy must allow us to go further in the dialogue with the African partners, especially in the framework of the Rabat Process, in the framework of the relationship between the European Union and the African Union.
Mr President, I speak today not only as a representative of my political group and a member of the EU-Russia delegation but also as the only native Russian-speaking Member of this Parliament.
Another, simpler, daily example is that of fires.
1.breakdown of part-time jobs by sex and age; 2. reasons why part-time work is chosen by companies and in national policies; 3. hourly pay for part-time work; 4. levels of segregation by profession for part-time work in comparison with full-time work; 5. skills required for part-time jobs; 6. relation between part-time work and poverty; 7. effects of part-time work on pensions and other replacement incomes; 8. effect on income throughout working life; 9. access to early retirement.This information would provide us with accurate statistics on the extent to which part-time work discriminates against women.
The European Union needs to decide on its policies and recommendations to the governments of the Member States by means of a comprehensive assessment - which is not, as all too often happens, purely moralist - of the various strategies being followed in the various countries, especially with regard to prevention, damage limitation and consumer safety in the face of the constant emergence of new synthetic drugs.
However I would say to Mr Samland - who is perfectly aware of this, moreover, but did not wish to say so here - that expenditure now amounts to some 1.15 % of Community GDP, whereas three or four years ago, it was around 1.20 %.
We have embarked on a policy in Iran of tough-minded but constructive engagement.
7.
Staff will be recruited from the Commission, the Council Secretariat and the Member States.
The truth of the matter, and we should accept it, is that there have been forces such as these, fundamentalists and terrorists, in Afghanistan since the 14th century.
That is certainly an aim on which there are no differences.
This, let me stress once again, was really the crucial point which also caused Rambouillet to fail, and it is the crucial point for future negotiations.
In January, we expressed our opposition to the unrestrained privatisation of basic services such as water and sewerage, as well as health services and education.
In this case, it seems that the combined attention of our rapporteur and the Court of Auditors is finding a real will within the Foundation to respond to the remarks made.
We cannot speak of absolutely permanent situations, but NUTS must not be modified too often and of course we must have a system which is based on certain rules and certain pre-established principles.
Police action during the European Council in Gothenburg does not fall within the competence of the Council.
You can see our proposal on my website.
Madam President, I should like to speak today from a reader' s perspective and consider both the good and bad points of electronic publishing.
The requirement for justification has yet to be taken into account by the Commission.
I would also like to take the opportunity to thank my fellow Committee members for excellent collaboration within the Committee in drawing up this report.
Of course, the European Parliament representation at the UN conference on the least developed countries in Istanbul will be 'armed' with a good resolution expressing satisfactory positions.
Mr President, Mr López Garrido, as the Spanish Presidency has just said, last week the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, adopted a communication on clean and energy-efficient vehicles, and I had the pleasure of presenting this text as a priority issue to the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy themselves during my hearing last Wednesday.
In the previous parliamentary term, the European Parliament adopted eight resolutions on Tibet and debated the matter many times.
Do we still think we can prevent the inevitable market crisis?
(The sitting was opened at 10.00)
In relation to your Committee on Regional Development, Mr Janowski, obviously major hubs cannot grow infinitely.
During the time the Fund has been in use, omissions and failings have become evident, and for this reason reform is required to remedy these failings, and to respond to the dangers that face us.
That I understand.
The reason for that is that a race against time has been built into the Protocol.
It would be damaging if the spirit of solidarity, which for historical reasons has placed greater demands on France than on others to the extent that we have the largest contingent, were to be turned by your absence into a climate of post-colonial suspicion.
All this is necessary because, on the threshold of the third millennium, we believe that guaranteeing the quality of life means taking all the necessary initiatives in planning, organization, management and control to ensure complete protection for the individual against the dangers of radiation, in particular that resulting from medical exposure.
I hope that there will be some additional flexibility on this in the package.
On everything from immigration and asylum, visas, civil law, criminal justice and policing, we have effectively given the European Union that ultimate attribute of statehood: a monopoly of coercive legal force over its citizens, that is to say, a system of criminal justice.
The flagship proposals in the Commission's Europe 2020 strategy are important tools to create that Europe, provided that we can make them come true.
No real assessments have been carried out in this area.
To achieve this object, we are offered - under the euphemism of a 'pact' - a whole arsenal full of bureaucratic, repressive mechanisms, enabling the Commission and Council to discipline the Member States, like naughty children, when their budgetary performance fails to comply with the 'stability programmes' laid down in advance, and with the criteria set by the Treaty.
To put any added burden on it at this moment in time is quite wrong.
On Turkey, we are all aware that we do not have an easy way ahead of us, either for Turkey or for the European Union, as was clearly stated by many during the debate.
That does not help the European Union, especially during the critical period we are going through at the moment, a period when everything is changing and which will require genuinely positive action on the part of the European Union. We will have somehow to reconsider how to restore to the EU budget its true political role.
   The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
In this respect, the regulation is quite simply being ignored by the Office’s investigators.
We shall now proceed to the vote on the proposal for a decision on the appointment of the new Commissioner proposed by the Republic of Bulgaria, Mrs Meglena Kuneva.
They conducted investigations on what happened in Gaza and came up with conclusions that are disturbing to say the least.
I am to some extent reassured by what you have to say, Commissioner, because it shows that something is being done and that a process of reflection is under way. I have, however, to say that it differs very little from the answers your predecessors have given me over the past seven years.
It has not been easy; we have all made concessions, but we have managed to produce a text that satisfies the majority and which the Council agreed on following many meetings, both formal and informal.
The ban on the Democratic Society Party (DTP) has destroyed, and thus negated, the Kurdish people's freedom of expression, of association and of political participation for the umpteenth time.
I want to pay tribute to the many European and other non-governmental organizations which work tirelessly to improve conditions on the ground.
I am pleased that, as a new Member of this esteemed House, I have been able, in my maiden speech, to participate in a good piece of European lawmaking, and I hope that there will be broad agreement here with what I have said and that the Council of Ministers will not have any problems in adopting the directive.
We need, first and foremost, to make progress on these.
It is plain for all to see that harmonising copyright in the European Union has become an urgent necessity.
I believe that any solution aimed at avoiding deforestation must also take into account systems for compensating farmers, including those farmers in Europe who grow these types of stratified crops.
Once these national elements have been eliminated, in the name of efficiency, the greatest responsibility is to reduce the distance that has been created between citizens and the EU, and the best way of doing that is to build a Europe that produces results when it comes to its citizens' concerns, such as the economy and employment.
Countries such as India and Nigeria are asking for the WTO agreements to be applied flexibly, and rightly so.
At the summit in Seville we approved an ambitious timetable.
India and China will not forego progress in the name of climate alarmism.
(DE) Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, let me express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur.
His will be the first of a series of speeches by religious leaders before the plenary of this House in the context of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
I am sure that every one of us in this Chamber wants an end to the bloodshed and that we want a peaceful settlement in Sri Lanka.
They have recommended to Members of Parliament that you should approve this proposal without any amendment and I invite Parliament to follow the recommendation of the rapporteur and approve the proposal without amendments.
Jokes aside, I recognise the exhaustive manner with which the report encompasses the general regulations governing the energy sector.
The public and private television system in our country, in which left-wing journalists get fat on hundreds of millions in pay, is not Al-Jazeera, while the far-left dailies – which are always blasting away at the government – take the government’s money.
While thinking of these changes, we must not, however, forget about their effective implementation, so that we can ensure the easiest possible transition to the new principles.
Despite the fact that a Directive on oil reception facilities has been adopted, there has been no reduction in deliberate oil discharges.
There are referenda to be won in the applicant states.
A great deal has been said about the EU’s common foreign policy recently, in particular with regard to the Constitutional Treaty.
I should particularly like to thank the chairman, Mr Böge, and the rapporteur, Mr Medina, for the excellent work they have done.
The European Union would have to face up to a new reality on the ground: the possibility for a peaceful transfer of land will be lost; the Turkish army will continue to guard what will remain a militarised border; UN peacekeepers will patrol within the European Union.
We have tried to introduce a system which will call for efforts to be made with the laboratories, with the health structures of our wealthy countries, and with the structures of the poorer countries. The aim of the system is that each time a patient is taken in for treatment here, something should be given to ensure that an almost similar course of treatment can be contemplated in countries where it previously was not.
That is what happens in my country and that is what happens in any democracy that is fundamentally based on democratic rights.
Prosperity comes from a secure workforce and a society that invests in all its citizens, excluding no-one.
We should also take note that research scientists are already leaving the USA for the UK and Asia to avoid the problems created by the introduction of a deadline.
(The President declared the common position approved)
I welcome the clauses on reciprocity between Brazilian nationals and EU citizens, and the guarantee of equality of treatment for all EU citizens.
After giving off this bad impression - the Americans had to intervene to find a solution! - the EU seems to be showing its own inefficiencies, its own inability with regard to reconstruction too.
This is just the latest in a series of incidents over recent years, especially lately, incidents which often have what might well be seen as comic-tragic overtones.
The consequences of this crisis have been primarily felt in the field of employment.
Let me read Rule 19 to you: "The President shall direct all the activities of Parliament and its bodies under the conditions laid down in these Rules.
I would like to emphasise on this point the need to focus particular attention on the Black Sea and create dedicated bodies for managing it.
That is only one example, however.
Although there are still two regulations, there is only one fund, which means that structural intervention can be properly dealt with in the fisheries sector.
As far as the structure of the common agricultural policy is concerned, I have said several times that, in my opinion, the common agricultural policy must consist of two pillars in order not only to make the achievement of the CAP's objectives clearer, but also to ensure that the instruments at our disposal are managed better.
Without this...there is not much hope!
I wish to deal with them.
I worked in a very loyal manner with him.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is up and running.
The aim is to make the Union more credible, more effective and more visible in security and defence terms.
Together, then, with the Group of the European People’s Party and with the Liberals – and I hope that the Socialist Group will join us in supporting this – we have brought in a resolution endorsing your position and with the intention of examining what options are available.
As you know, the Commission said last year that it would be a dangerous precedent to change the way the President of the Commission is chosen by replacing the concertation and acclamation procedure with a vote.
Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them.
For the South Tyroleans, this is a daily reminder of an injustice suffered.
Employers and employees do not, therefore, have a good enough knowledge of their duties and rights, and that is a situation that we must do something about.
Another important element is that importers of products from countries outside the EU are required to ensure that the goods in question satisfy the applicable Community requirements.
Mrs Green, I proposed to the House - and the House approved my proposal - to read out Mr Pasty's letter as well, just as any letter of self-defence would be read out. And under no circumstances can this right to self-defence be restricted.
I am sorry to overrun, Madam President, but you will admit I was interrupted by some colleagues in an entirely unnecessary way.
We do not have any historic or dazzling events lined up, but that does not worry us at all.
It is reported that not all 25 Member States have ratified the Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 (14242/01) which would allow joint investigation Teams to be set up.
But I find that Mr Donnelly has become extraordinarily realistic and I can only applaud him.
The great Polish European Władysław Bartoszewski once said: 'Europe means above all else freedom of the individual and human rights - both political and economic'.
The economic crisis has hit the entire world, including the countries in the eurozone.
Another point which concerns me is who can afford to surf the Internet?
Secondly, diversification, and especially a move towards renewable energy sources.
The debate is closed.
I will now quickly comment on each of the six countries individually.
As has been said, the main difficulties arise from the numerous conflicts between the various countries of the region.
The Director of the Commission's anti-fraud unit, UCLAF, went to Andorra in December 1997 for talks with the country's government.
Of course traffic emissions will increase, because it is by far the most effective way of transporting people and goods.
(Applause)
Thirdly, oil pollution and nuclear damage are not covered with the argument that they are covered by international conventions.
Unless all colleagues move together to do this, and all countries move together to do this, that discrimination is going to remain.
Tackling climate change is the challenge of our time.
I actually believe that there is a renewed desire to move clearly and resolutely towards the target of 0.7%.
This should be seen as just one exercise.
The JPC noted the need to closely monitor progress with the SAPARD, Phare and Ispra programmes and to ensure that Lithuania is fully prepared to exploit the structural and rural funding possibilities after accession.
In addition, it strengthens the EU’s ability to act as a cohesive and unified power in the international community, which is very important in the light of the events in South-East Asia.
Moreover, from the first day that it was completed, we would have, in addition to these emergency procedures, extra money for countries wishing to start carrying out resettlement, and clear categories for priorities to be used by the Member States.
While there have been a number of well-documented, unacceptable abuses, it is also true that some countries have developed certain practices and customs that actually enhance the prestige of their parliamentary assemblies and lend them their own particular character and flavour.
I particularly welcome your involvement in the ongoing issues of the transposition and implementation of the new regulatory framework in the Member States.
So I say to those people who voted against the report in committee: if you had got your way, there is no way we would be standing here today.
We have to increase funding to achieve vital growth in Europe.
This question, too, naturally affects the progress of negotiations on fundamental rights and liberties, which are dealt with in a chapter of their own.
What we really need - and this has been pointed out and called for on several occasions - is a European Year against Violence.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is intended to provide swift assistance to those workers who have fallen victim to structural changes in international trade patterns.
Since then the European Union has prevented them from voting.
This should involve, above all, sending a clear message to those countries which want to aspire to membership of the EU that solving territorial problems and at least partial resolution of the matter of refugees are basic conditions for thinking seriously about membership in the near or distant future.
This, in particular, is the importance of Europe's GMES in the world GEO process.
For Europe's security it would be very important to launch the cooperation on crisis management agreed at the meeting of November 2003, especially in respect of frozen conflicts.
Logically, the same criteria for insurance protection in a system of transport initially regarded as very risky and used by a minority of the population can no longer apply.
We had a Dutch TV channel for five years at a stretch in the other building and suddenly we find that we no longer have one.
I cannot, however, under any circumstances accept revenge policies, excommunications and witch hunts.
Similarly, through the Danesin report and the Commission communication we must seek clarity in the implementation of competition rules to avoid any distortion of competition within and between the Member States.
Mr President, in this report we do have reference to the mobilisation of the EU solidarity fund, which we talked about slightly earlier.
In certain areas, such as urban transport, energy efficiency, the water cycle and support for SMEs, the EIB has clearly developed expertise that is rather unique.
Such a thing is absolutely unacceptable, and we endorse the motion that it be made the subject of a debate in this House.
I thank Mr Maat very much for that.
On land registers, the report favours improving access to standardised information, as well as supporting further work on the European Land Information Service.
Mrs Thors has already mentioned issues about the mutual recognition of qualifications.
Thirdly, are the programmes’ titles being lost?
However, this afternoon's gesture reflects, on the part of the European Parliament, a sense of confidence and a future in the easing of tensions, a rediscovered cultural diversity, and a willingness to accept the peoples representing such cultural diversity.
I hope we will continue the discussion on water, as so many of our citizens are very concerned with this issue.
In a democracy, Mr Orbán, the media monitor those who are in power.
Candidate countries, like Member States, must therefore show the utmost sensitivity in matters such as this.
We know, and you were quite right to remind us, that the Commission will have greater responsibilities in terms of foreign policy.
There are also some very positive things that have been produced.
The problem of continuity of contract was already settled by the regulations which we examined some time past, and the report now basically deals with regulations to be adopted, either by the national authorities of the Member States, or by professional organizations.
That does not, however, prevent the Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere.
The biggest exporting countries Russia, Ukraine, China and Mexico have already been forced to import in order to ensure their supply.
We will come to North Korea in a moment but we have to look at our policy with regard to the region as one which has to be integrated, comprehensive and positive.
Problems of forgery and dumping, the question of origin marking and mutual respect for the rules are issues that must be tackled and resolved decisively, if we want to prevent an unfair market from destroying the Union's production sectors and doing long-term damage to emerging or developing countries also, with disastrous consequences in terms of unemployment and social policies.
Implementing the Mexico agreement therefore serves a pilot function.
It is that way that we should make our own over the coming weeks.
The fact is that, in the streets and in the icy cold, the Ukrainian people have, in the course of a month, chosen the camp in which they are to build their future: the camp of democracy, non-violence and Europe.
It recognises that the EU has no competence to determine the health policies of Member States, still less to set their budgets or spending priorities for Member States' health services.
The report recognizes that many of the difficulties affecting transit are a direct result of the fact that the customs union is made up of 15 different administrations.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten.
The association agreement provides an instrument which would help promote both regions' common economic, social and geopolitical interests.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for relenting on the very important issue of Amendment 6, which states 'All human beings are born equal and therefore human rights are indivisible and inviolable'.
In this way we would at the same time be fulfilling our own share of our environmental targets.
We thought we had the matter under control, but we did not.
The communication is still under preparation and the precise content has not yet been agreed on.
My question, which I have asked indirectly before, is whether it is also the Council's intention that such an action plan against drugs should be incompatible with support for liberal drug projects.
On the second part, that will be taken into account when we review the operation of the roll-call vote system, which we shall be doing shortly.
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler and I have today presented a communication to the Commission on the link between agriculture and environmental policy.
There is, however, a division of labour and I think we should keep it as long as this is the wish of Kofi Annan.
Madam President, of course I must take issue with the previous speaker, Mr Swoboda.
We should know that the universal application of principles is the best basis to start and build relationships.
To be effective, OLAF needs less interference and less political pressure when it comes both to the appointments made to it and to the investigations it conducts.
In accordance with the conclusions of the Feira European Council, the Commission will report back to the Council on the progress made in preparing the analytical examination of the acquis with Turkey.
We believe that we should aim to prevent the multi-nationals from doing what they like with workers' rights, and the European Union has sufficient weapons to hand to prevent this.
It is a first step in the right direction. It will only be successful in the long run, however, if consumers change their attitude and demand these products.
The Commission proposal which sought a solution was blocked for a long time by the Belgian Government. Its view was that from 1995 the normal rate had to apply in all Member States.
As proposed in the report we want to combat the trend which has allowed property speculation and a lack of financial resources offering reasonable terms for loans to turn the housing sector into a 'high cost sector' to which only the well off have access.
I urge that this be approved.
To be clear, despite repeated requests, there has been no explanation to this day for why the product was withdrawn.
When parents emigrate for work, these children are also left alone.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the matter addressed by Mr Barón Crespo's question flows from the case of the footwear sector, because the entire production system of Member States has been thrown into a crisis, and not merely from today, by unfair competition - or, to put it more plainly, by the remorseless and unbridled financial greed of the so-called free market: a market that would be better defined as being without rules, which preys on individuals like a vampire, exploiting workers without paying heed to their age and without any social security remotely comparable to that which is in force in countries of the European Union.
It is not possible for the European Union in the 21st century to allow conditions similar to slave labour in any branch of work.
Yet these measures alone are not enough; further action is needed, and for this reason, in December 2006, the Commission proposed that air transport should be included in the Community system for emission allowance trading.
   . Mr President, six weeks ago, this Parliament urged the authorities in Belarus to call free and fair parliamentary elections on 7 October 2004 and to abandon a referendum to change the constitution.
The OSCE/ODIHR official report concluded that the elections clearly failed to meet OSCE standards for democratic elections.
In this connection, the Commission will continue to attach great importance to its relations with Parliament.
As you already know, ladies and gentlemen, not only am I pleased to be back here in Brussels for the second time as Vice President, as you probably know, some American politicians and American journalists refer to Washington DC as the capital of the free world.
It is not only a political problem, but also a social one, with the citizens' increasing feeling of alienation from politics, and this is something we find in all our countries.
Of course, I am referring, as everyone knows, to the great question of the regulatory committee, a question which remains open even after these initial negotiations.
The right to strike as such must not be jeopardised, and it is undoubtedly right that in the balance between the four freedoms, greater emphasis should be laid on economic issues.
If that is the case we obviously have a pretty successful Turkish policy.
It is surprising that the Council, at a time when so many fundamental rights abound, is vacillating on this issue and dares to attack one of European citizens' basic guarantees.
As I stated, the obligation on current port operators to absorb the labour force contracted to ports on salaries around three times higher than the average in sectors with identical operational requirements means that the directive will not be able to allow a port user to engage in cargo-handling activity without having to be accredited, thereby using workers in more favourable conditions than those binding current port operators under the law and under collective bargaining agreements.
What is the issue?
The first reason concerns the need for strict compliance with the agreement on the use of the recasting procedure concluded between Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
We are expecting the Commission to give this Chamber some concrete answers, which so far have not been forthcoming.
This infighting is responsible for the risk of a new, even bloodier war, now that NATO, the USA and the European Union are directly involved, which is what the Euro-unifying forces seem to be seeking after the war in Libya.
I think it has been a successful year.
EU governments fully recognise that the development of the European economy cannot be achieved unless we take full advantage of new and evolving information technologies.
President Lula made this point very strongly at the first EU-Brazil summit in July.
Finally, I would like to point out that there has been talk of the collapse of the world of football.
Mr President, I have never been a unilateral disarmer at any stage in my political career, in any context.
The Hanns-Seidel Foundation has been supporting democratic-related projects there for many years and a former Member of this House, the sadly now deceased Minister of State, Mr Fritz Pirkl, supported the cause of democracy in Fiji more than almost anyone else.
In the directive on electronic commerce we now have before us, the basis is the country of origin.
I believe that all these guarantees must and can be assessed afterwards by Parliament, which I intend to consult again at successive stages, starting with the workshop to be held on 6 November.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))
As Ms Gräßle mentioned, this proposal started in 2004, when times were completely different.
What Terry Wynn said is true: we have, after all, suggested a radical overhaul of expenditure, and consideration of what expenditure is still necessary, whether things should be done differently, whether a number of institutions are overlapping in terms of responsibilities, whether there are bureaux that duplicate the work.
   Mr President, please allow me to congratulate you on the award of the Charlemagne Prize, which is also good news for this Parliament; a Parliament which, since 1984, has wanted a Constitution, through the Spinelli Treaty, then through the Herman, Oreja and Colombo projects which called for the establishment of the Convention in 1997 and which, after Nice, opted for the Convention.
We have to eliminate the bureaucracy and we actually have to talk about more efficiency in laws and legislation.
However, what we are absolutely clear about is that there is a right under the Directive for medical monitoring of the survivors, proper surveillance and intervention measures - not merely statistical exercises as have been conducted to date, but proper clinical, medical monitoring that would benefit not only those survivors but also the health and safety of all Europe's citizens in the event of such future incidents.
But, even though the agreement reached in Council is an important step forward and very positive news, this is not yet the end of the process.
The cost in time and money of training a highly specialized workforce is in itself a barrier to maintaining existing jobs, when a skilled worker leaves a firm temporarily or for good.
But I would remind you what this Question Time is for.
We are not against this in principle, but a democratic development, the involvement of the population and the observation of environmental standards, which are required by the World Bank, ought to be assured.

Progress in the area of electrical and electronic equipment means a longer usable life span, a reduction in the weight of individual appliances as a result of miniaturisation and a reduction in energy consumption.
One effect of this has been, for example, to increase the number of death sentences, and more than 300 000 people have been arrested, a number of them having been tortured.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, as symbolic as it may be in this institutional triangle, we are all the same witnessing with astonishment today an essential act of the European Parliament - the discharge - taking place, and one key participant is missing.
We need to create a system that can also function.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Regarding the first question, there have been numerous bilateral meetings during the autumn in order to try to facilitate and prepare for the negotiations.
We would not want to be treated by a drunken doctor and I do not believe that we should be treated by an over-tired doctor.
We support Mr van der Waal's report because we believe that his principles are right, that his views are right and that that is the only way the inland waterways sector can go forward.
It is with this strong belief that it is by opening up the democratic channels for countries under oppressive regimes that we as Europeans can help these countries that I made - and again would repeat - my point on the importance and usefulness of people-to-people contacts, the usefulness of support for businesses, the usefulness - despite the great difficulties, the very unfortunate disrespect for minorities, which we condemn - of remaining engaged in a way that would lift up the chances of the Belarusian people to take the road to a free world and to be connected with the Union, and I would repeat the call for us to remain engaged in that way.
We, and certainly the Member States, missed opportunities during the enlargement process.
We have made good progress with what the Commission has put forward, but the Commission's programme is lacking a great many important parts.
Where financing in particular is concerned, we are today faced with great uncertainty regarding the future of this cohesion policy.
As far as development cooperation is concerned, the European Union has enough funds to create sufficient structures in the field of vocational education and training.
These victims should have a priority right to free legal aid, penalties against traffickers should be more severe and ways should be found of discouraging the demand for services by clients.
The report refers to the possibility of direct complete dismantling and of staged decommissioning, where dismantling to 'green field' level takes 135 years - none of us would even live to see it.
Our budget is basically 1% of Europe's GDP, which is derisory in comparison with the 20% of GDP committed by the United States at federal level.
Five: we must not confine these technologies to primary, secondary and tertiary and traditional forms of education; we must also consider adults, lifelong learning and all the people outside the formal education cycle and process, as well as taking account of the huge role of these technologies in combating unemployment.
I feel that we did a good job, not least as regards the most vulnerable, with the Development Agenda itself, with Everything but Arms, with technical assistance measures and capacity building, with the ground-breaking decision on lifesaving medicines, with regard to which we showed ourselves to be willing a long time before the United States.
Twenty-seven years after 1974, there is still a huge number of cases - over 1000 - of people whose fate is still unknown.
On the subject of the Convention, the European Council, in conformity with the Laeken Declaration, will hear a report at the Brussels meeting from the Chairman of the Convention, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, on the progress which has been made with the Convention's work.
That is appalling. There is a shocking divergence in standards of epilepsy care throughout the European Union.
These floating dumps, however, are treated with a reprehensible tolerance by some shipping companies and some flag States, not least Turkey, which heads the blacklist.
We feel that this recommendation is a major step forwards, particularly in the field of maritime safety, especially since the statistics of past years are extremely alarming: in the last 10 years, between 1990 and 1999, we recorded the sinking of 146 bulk carriers and the deaths of 780 crew members, all of which occurred during the loading or unloading of these carriers.
(Audio problems)
It is because they are complex, remote and not understood.
However, now we actually need to deliver something.
That is why it is incredibly important never to retreat from those values on which EU cooperation is based and to make it clear to our large neighbour that we shall not do so.
Thirdly, the current Community financial resources for the cohesion policy are insufficient to meet the needs of real convergence, regional disparities, high levels of unemployment, inequalities in income and poverty in the European Union. We therefore reiterate the need to increase the Community budget, making the promotion of economic and social cohesion in the European Union the central and primordial objective.
Either we go on in the same way and the continent of Africa will continue to go under, or we radically change direction and can start to breathe, particularly in Africa, and, I say again, this will be through subsistence agriculture, which must take priority over international trade.
There are 34 countries which produce cluster bombs, including 13 EU Member States.
   Mr President, I will start by quoting an article by Gideon Levy published in on 3 September 2006.
(EL) Mr President, the Commission proposal aims to strengthen the role of the Schengen Evaluation Working Group by making this mechanism more efficient and transparent so as to safeguard the effective and consistent application of the Schengen acquis.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Madam President, poverty, misery and starvation are the daily lot for the more than two billion members of the earth's population who live on less than two dollars a day.
Lastly, I believe that there is an urgent need to relaunch the European economy and that we must pull out all the stops to ensure that this happens.
I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that, in future, all the directives are dealt with under Article 152, since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview.
We are pleased that the Council is taking a step in the right direction by reducing this.
These speeches are available to all Members who wish to refer to them.

European regional policy after 2013 must cover all the regions, while being sufficiently flexible to take into account regional and territorial differences.
I was not at that time a Member of this House, but I had the opportunity to experience, on the spot, the way in which the so-called international community had almost ostentatiously abandoned that country, delivering it up, as it were, to the tanks of Serb-dominated Communist Yugoslavia. Slovenia perceived this abandonment as an encouragement to attack, which it duly did two days later.
A ban on soft drugs simply leads to young people rebelling and eases their move onto the use of hard drugs.
My group will wait to see this report before it decides whether to support the calls for a committee of inquiry to be set up.

More than 40 countries in the world belong to the category of least developed countries.
This Parliament showed its commitment to that in the conciliation process in last year's budget when we fought for and achieved additional funding for the present Socrates programme and the Commission and the Council do not doubt the overwhelming agreement across the parties in this Parliament to put extra money into education.
Pineapples may not in fact matter, because the outer part is not eaten, but it would be quite unreasonable for peaches.
The second problem is that the social problems entailed and which (for better and, particularly, for worse) are a very significant part of actual life in the European Union have been ignored.
Like the government, I am therefore of the opinion that the Commission's proposal for harmonisation is heading in the wrong direction when account must be taken, for example, of the practice in Malta.
While there have been significant improvements, cross-border provision of investment services continues to be dogged by legal uncertainty and impediments.
Hence we in the GUE/NGL Group support it, but you may be sure that we shall be following the matter closely and seeking to ensure that watercourses do get better protection in future.
However, thanks to this Union, the Member States have an opportunity to transfer part of their sovereignty to supranational bodies, such as the Commission and the European Central Bank, in order to exercise this sovereignty jointly and equally and in order to become stronger and more powerful on the international stage.
Particular emphasis should be placed on all of these issues because they have an influence on the awareness of society and on the way this horrendous phenomenon is reported.

However, we do have serious misgivings on the issue of the reversal of the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the accused.
And how is it involved?
Among many important aspects that deserve comment or criticism, we would highlight that, despite this report clarifying certain aspects of the proposal for a regulation, such as regarding as serious infringements only those infringements which have been effectively confirmed as such in accordance with the relevant national legislation - which we regard as positive - it still does not safeguard the sovereignty of each Member State in terms of the management of fishing activities in their EEZs (Exclusive Economic Zones), with which we disagree.
One more question for Mrs Fischer Boel: what is your view of such a certification system?
I hope that those involved in fishing in the outermost regions will be able to take advantage of this new extension to develop and modernise the fleet.
But here we must decide clearly where the priorities lie and where we can then cut back.
Let me say a word about the report by Mr Saryusz-Wolski.
Also, how is it that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) can name both countries, Ukraine and Russia, as responsible for the problems concerning natural gas supplies to the EU, but our recommendations only challenge Russia?
This sculpture reminds us once again that Europe is not just a continent, or a political and economic unit, but also an imaginary person.
The instruments are there.
In particular, I wish to refer to Carlos Costa Neves, who has chaired the inter-group 'For East Timor' and who has taken part in each of the European Parliament' s missions to that country.
However, careful monitoring of fish-spawning grounds is also necessary and should lead to short-term closures of certain areas.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Swedish Presidency sees the EU' s Mediterranean cooperation as an important and pressing issue.
Thus to reach a compromise he should have shared his reflections with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety: otherwise his position is a purely personal one, not one shared by the committee.
We are trying to clarify every case.
That goes without saying.
   The next item is the report (Α5-0355/2003) by Mr De Rossa, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on Petition 461/2000 concerning the protection and conservation of Great Apes and other species endangered by the illegal trade in bushmeat (2003/2078(ΙΝΙ)).
A breakthrough would be both useful and necessary on three points.
I would like to say to the President-in-Office of the Council that he has certainly succeeded and that he has avoided the worst possible situation, particularly in the latest exchanges, in other words endless haggling, when we are in fact facing an historic occasion.
There has been no further news of them.
We also need to think seriously about how to rebuild stability in the region after any strike.
The second point I would like to make is that we cannot continue with an interpretation made by one President and a different interpretation made by another President.

As I see it, however, funds from the Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity (Progress), particularly as proposed here, will enable people to go self-employed.
In July 1995, the Council confirmed these 1995 targets and set new ones for 1996.
I know that this report will be at least a recognition of some of the battles being fought in my own country by organisations such as INQUEST, where families are still trying to find out after many years what exactly happened when family members died in police custody, yet nothing is being made public and there is no proper retribution.
She has covered much of the ground as to the reasons behind her proposals.
That would considerably facilitate the handling of this disease.
It stands to reason that more time has been taken out to strike the best balance between aid to poor countries and attention to the economic strength of our own.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe that we dream of is first and foremost the Europe of human rights, then the Europe of the market; first the Europe of solidarity with smaller nations, then the competitive Europe.
Perhaps we shall soon see Mozart banned from international opera houses.
Now to the Bontempi report on the draft second Protocol to the Convention on the Protection of the Community's Financial Interests.

At the end of the day, failing to prevent murderers from committing their crimes makes us their accomplice.
We must not forget that these funds are subsidised by all taxpayers, so we want them to be used wisely and responsibly so that they are more productive and their effects still more keenly felt.
Alongside this immutable base there are some minor adjustments which it is fair to record.
It would seem that new Iron Curtains are to be put up.
Steps in this direction have been taken to increase Member States' support in the authorising process.
I believe that the very transparency we are calling for here is also justified by the Treaty of Lisbon and that, therefore, we must press hard for this Treaty to be brought to a favourable conclusion as quickly as possible.
Elections can only take place if people have enough information.
Given that young people and children are those most exposed to advertising on the internet, I am in favour of the need to develop an integrated European policy for combating the unregulated use of the Internet and means of communication.
This exercise in enhanced cooperation has proved a good early example of the virtues of codecision, which I hope may enter into force on the full ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, hopefully as soon as possible.
This situation lays bare some of the errors and weaknesses of cohesion policy which we have always denounced.
Europe cannot just be the sum of 27 national interests.
Next time it will be a Finn, and I will not treat him with kid gloves any more than I do you.
(PL) Mr President, I agree with the view that the Rules of Procedure have today been abused.
This is true, but Ukraine remains a state even after these elections.
I agree entirely with what Mrs Ojala said about the services sector.
It will take a decision on Thursday if the time is right, otherwise as soon as possible.
Do they know about that at Oxfam?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whenever we in this House simultaneously talk about the Europe of free movement and the Europe of diversity, it is rather like trying to square the circle. At the very least it is an extremely difficult conundrum to solve, and the solution varies from case to case.
As far as interest is concerned, we have compromised between the 6% proposed by Council and the 8% proposed by Parliament, agreeing in the conciliation procedure on 7%.
Congratulations once again.
If we have to adjourn and take up another subject, we should have an urgency debate on transport to Strasbourg!

Therefore it is an instrument to foster and to bring into a situation where everyone has an opportunity to make his living in a way in which innovation is involved.
As 'shadow rapporteur' for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I have also encountered a very constructive attitude, and that is something for which I am grateful.
What we asked was that the three committees that might have a very clear interest in this issue, namely the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs should look in depth at this issue and present an informed report to this House, so that we can have the sort of debate the issue merits.
We must all reflect on the consequences of the current institutional situation for all policies, including enlargement, and on the institutions themselves.
This, then, is my question to you, Mr President-in-Office.
Do I really have to make you a list of travellers' crimes?
We also know that, from this perspective, visa-free travel is the thing which people perhaps understand and feel the most.
It is clear that, regardless of intentions and apportionments, the problem may arise again unless measures are taken.
Bulgaria stands a good chance to absorb almost seven billion Euro over the period 2007 - 2013 as a full EU member.
The current legislation in force allows for derogation. This means competitive disadvantages for the European Union, so the time has come to a legislative revision in line with the present market relations.

I shall first give an indirect reply to your first question by saying that that the exchange rates applied to the Union as an average clearly do not correspond to the specific countries which make up the Union.
Should it include the issue of the environment?
At this point, I would like to mention the growing poverty, the pillaging of natural resources and the attempts to curtail and sell off national industries.
You will remember that the extension was proposed as a means to bridge the period necessary to adjust to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and to submit a new regulation on the future EU GSP scheme.
I am seriously concerned that unless the Commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a cohesive Europe, we will make progress on the economic front, on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy, but our citizens will still remain fearful because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand.
I would like to stress two points, should any bilateral agreements be concluded.
Given how much these transactions currently amount to - recently, this was 70 times the global GNP - such a tax could free up EUR 10 billion per year.

Some of the 30 cases in Germany are so dramatic that I want to describe one of them to you.
The following Members are appointed as tellers:
This need appears to be all the more urgent following the recent results for the European Constitution in France and the Netherlands.
At a time when fish stocks are in decline and when some people on this planet do not have enough to eat, it is shameful that we catch good fish, kill it and then throw it back into the sea to feed the gulls and the crabs.
The attention of the whole world is fixed on that great country and especially on the market opportunities it offers.
Based on the fact that what the Commission has said and what the Council has said are now on the record in this House, I would, as rapporteur, be delighted to recommend to the House that it should give assent to the Caribbean EPA.
I voted against the Fantuzzi resolution on Agenda 2000 and the reform of the CAP because in paragraph 8, the rapporteur actually claims that cofinancing is not meant to solve the problems and meet the needs of agriculture but to deal with the issue of the Member States' budget contributions.
Citizens' initiative (debate)
There have been many useful points made.
So we have farmers with Hugo Boss ties now. We did not have this five to ten years ago.
Madam President, at the moment, our airspace is at a standstill - we know this; it has already been mentioned.
Mr President, the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Vatanen are explicit and clear and push forward still further the militarisation of the European Union.

Mr President, first of all I will resist the temptation to list all the stations on the West Coast main line in my constituency and also on the trans-Pennine route.
I would like to congratulate you on that.
   .– Addition, as last paragraph to the oral explanation of vote already made by Ms Kratsa after the votes of the 06/07/05:
There are many such questions.
I believe that we must also take health aspects into account as part of the CO2 question, as illnesses that have to date existed only in the tropics will appear in Europe as a result of global warming, and there will also be other problems.
Colleagues, it is not necessary for the Council to be here.
Mr President, today’s debate here in the European Parliament is indeed timely.
I have to say that the Commission is not in any way being excluded from decisions on the Intergovernmental Conference, and I also have to say that Parliament' s role has been increased, with respect to Amsterdam, even if the progress is less than stated by the Commission and the President of Parliament during the Helsinki debate.
This was the first point I wished to make.
We must show political judgment and responsibility in order to understand what we can ask of the new Commission and in order to await and support the reform process proposed by President Prodi.
Lastly, I should especially like to congratulate the Spanish Government for taking the cotton issue to the European Court of Justice, as the Greek Government should have done in the case of tobacco.

Does this mean that, at the Dublin Summit, the UK will be the only Member State not to have pilot action programmes for the Local and Regional Territorial Pacts for Employment?

Well, they were anything but strong on the day.
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner, and thank you also for pursuing the matter of the Indian Government's failure to comply with regulations on opening up the markets for leather goods. I would however like to ask you as a matter of urgency to move things on as quickly as possible, so as to guarantee full compliance with the rules governing international trade.
   Mr President, the situation which has inspired this Resolution today demonstrates that human rights and respect for life, as higher values, are never entirely enjoyed and we democrats throughout the world must be alert at all times.
This crisis of world capitalism is enormously exacerbated by the activities of the financial speculators on the world markets.
We may disagree in other areas, but here we are strong and united.
It is about writing in clear, jargon-free language that ordinary people can understand.
We have to take this forward on two fronts: first, trade and customs measures that would allow for the integration of markets in goods and services, as well as in trade-related fields; and second, the preferential agreements with non-Member countries.
President-in-Office of the Council.
In Mexico, and especially in the province of Chiapas, infringements of human rights are constantly taking place.
The national parliaments and the European Parliament must have their say.
These documents are vital in shaping our ideas, in organising our thoughts.

We have to conclude the debate.
For this reason, we are proposing four amendments, which I would like to encourage you to vote for.
First of all, in budget line B 2-901, on the financial participation by the Community in control and surveillance activities in the waters of Member States, to be returned to the quantity provided for in the preliminary draft budget approved by the Commission: 39.5 MECU instead the 33 MECU now earmarked.

The Commission and the national competition authorities are carefully monitoring the market.
The second point is that the new instrument, while having the power to suspend the application of certain Italian laws, is not exempt from European law and European directives.
Are environmental agreements part of the additional measures which, according to page 22 of the Commission's statement, are missing in the present aviation agreements between the Member States and the US?
It deserves particular recognition for the manner in which it has solved the Rubik's cube with the appointments of Mr Van Rompuy and Lady Ashton.
I am voting for the report by Mr Simpson because I consider statistical returns in respect of carriage of goods and passengers by sea to be very useful.
Shipbuilding
Quite obviously, I think not.
Modern intensive plantations have a high density of low-yield trees, which are chopped down after a few years. These plantations use copious amounts of water for irrigation, up to 350 kg of fertiliser per hectare and pesticides and herbicides to clear the soil of vegetation.
As a point of principle, I very much hope that this House will reinsert the repair clause amendment.
The proposal to use sugar as a fuel is beyond the pale.
Analyses will also be necessary.
What we need, then - and here I am addressing you, Commissioner - is a prudent policy and sagacious concern for European shipyards.

That is a political judgment!
Some arguments have been put forward for the oil industry to annualise working time.
The commitments I have just mentioned would not be honoured if there were a change in corporate strategy, and the consequence – as we are now learning – would be a gradual reduction in employment levels through the implementation of as yet unspecified procedures.
The information society also means setting up democracy and freedom.
Enhancing strategic autonomy in security affairs entails, for the EU, the capacity to agree upon common political objectives and strategic guidelines, to establish strategic partnerships with relevant international organisations, including NATO, and with other countries, to collect adequate information and generate joint analyses and assessments, to harness and, where necessary, pool financial, civilian and military resources, to plan and run effective crisis management operations across the extended range of the Petersburg-type missions, and to frame and implement a common defence policy, laying the first tangible foundations on which to build common defence.

The Commission has already done a great deal to help combat violence in Europe through the Daphne Programme.
In this context, I must remind you that it was not Parliament but the Commission - Commissioner Marín himself - that ordered such cooperation to cease at the end of 1995.
